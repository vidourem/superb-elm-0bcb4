## Building for production üèó

To build a static site for production, run the following command

```shell
npm run build
```

The generated site will be written to the `.next` folder. The contents of this folder can be deployed by a serverless deployment platform such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). You can test the production build by running `npm run build && npm run start`.
